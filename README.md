# Front End Dev Assignment

Continuing to work with the songs API that we built earlier to interact with the music_library, build out an AngularJS front end to connect to the backend you should already have up and running.

For the front end functionality you should be able to:

[x]See all the songs
[x]Add a new song. Do input validation to make sure you have always have an artist and track title. New songs should get rank 1.
[x]Delete a song
Up vote a song to increase its rank
Stretch goals:e

Make the entire song editable
Update your database structure to require the track name and artist. Set the rank to 1 by default. (Make sure the database create script is updated to do this as well.)
Take a look at Angular Material. We will talk more about it next week, but you can explore a bit on your own if you have time.
